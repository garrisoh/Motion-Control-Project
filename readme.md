# 3D Motion Control Project

### Who are we?
We are a group of students that belong to a tech team within our student chapter of ASME.  We are dedicated to exploring
3D motion control by using a Leap Motion controller to control a robotic arm.

### How to use:
Install and run the LeapMotion daemon (not provided), and the Breakout server (in the Breakout directory).
Open up index.html in a web browser, and open up an inspector, such as Firebug, so you can read console output and debug scripts.
Move hand over Leap to control robot. distance between fingers controls the grip separation. Make a fist if you want the program to ignore your hand temporarily.
If the arm gets messed up (slams into table or something and won't move), refresh the page. The arm will be reset and will return to its default position.
